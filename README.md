> **Your complete hub for learning, building, and mastering Agentic AI systems** 🚀

Welcome to the most comprehensive resource for **Agentic AI** - the cutting-edge field where AI systems can act autonomously, make decisions, and collaborate with other agents to solve complex problems. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps or an expert pushing the boundaries, this repository has everything you need.

## 🌟 What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that can:
- 🎯 **Act autonomously** towards specific goals
- 🧠 **Make decisions** based on their environment and objectives  
- 🤝 **Collaborate** with other agents and humans
- 🔧 **Use tools** and external resources dynamically
- 📚 **Learn and adapt** from experience and feedback
- 🎭 **Take on specialized roles** within larger systems

Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to inputs, agentic AI proactively pursues objectives, making it perfect for complex, real-world applications like research assistance, code generation, customer service, and automated business processes.

### 📦 **Manual Installation**

### 1. **Choose Your Framework**
```bash
# For beginners - start with LangChain
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langgraph

# For multi-agent systems - try AutoGen  
pip install autogen-agentchat autogen-ext

# For role-based agents - use CrewAI

pip install llama-index llama-index-core

# For type-safe agents - try PydanticAI
pip install pydantic-ai

# For lightweight agents - use Smolagents
pip install smolagents
```

```python
# Modern LangChain + LangGraph agent example
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    try:
        return str(eval(expression))
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

# Create and run agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
agent = create_react_agent(llm, [calculator])
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [("user", "What is 25 * 4 + 10?")]})
```

**Alternative: PydanticAI (Type-Safe)**
```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

# Type-safe agent with structured outputs
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='You are a helpful math assistant.')
result = agent.run_sync('What is 25 * 4 + 10?')
print(result.data)
```
```
