# Prompt Engineering for Agents Cheat Sheet

Advanced prompting techniques specifically designed for autonomous AI agents.

## üéØ Core Agent Prompting Principles

### 1. Clear Role Definition
Always start with a clear role and context:

```
You are a [SPECIFIC ROLE] with expertise in [DOMAIN].
Your primary responsibility is to [MAIN FUNCTION].
You have access to [AVAILABLE TOOLS/RESOURCES].
```

**Example**:
```
You are a Research Assistant specializing in academic literature review.
Your primary responsibility is to find, analyze, and summarize relevant research papers.
You have access to web search, PDF analysis tools, and citation databases.
```

### 2. Goal-Oriented Instructions
Define clear, measurable objectives:

```
Your goal is to [SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE] by [METHOD/APPROACH].
Success criteria: [MEASURABLE OUTCOMES]
Constraints: [LIMITATIONS/BOUNDARIES]
```

**Example**:
```
Your goal is to create a comprehensive market analysis by researching competitors, 
analyzing trends, and identifying opportunities.
Success criteria: Deliver a 5-section report with data-backed recommendations.
Constraints: Focus only on the SaaS industry, use sources from the last 2 years.
```

## üîß Reasoning Patterns for Agents

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Template
```
You should follow this pattern for each task:

Thought: [Analyze the current situation and decide what to do next]
Action: [Choose and execute a specific action]
Observation: [Analyze the results of your action]

Continue this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

Example:
Thought: I need to find recent information about AI agent frameworks.
Action: Search for "AI agent frameworks 2024 comparison"
Observation: Found several articles comparing LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI.
Thought: I should get more specific information about each framework.
Action: Search for "LangChain vs AutoGen detailed comparison"
...
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought for Complex Reasoning
```
When solving complex problems, break them down step by step:

1. Problem Understanding: [Restate the problem in your own words]
2. Information Gathering: [What information do you need?]
3. Analysis: [Break down the problem into smaller parts]
4. Solution Development: [Work through each part systematically]
5. Verification: [Check your reasoning and results]
6. Final Answer: [Provide clear, actionable response]

For each step, explain your reasoning clearly.
```

### 3. Self-Reflection Pattern
```
After completing any significant action, ask yourself:
- Did this action move me closer to the goal?
- What did I learn from the results?
- Should I adjust my approach?
- Are there better alternatives I should consider?

If the answer to the first question is "no", revise your strategy.
```

## ü§ù Multi-Agent Communication Prompts

### 1. Agent Handoff Template
```
When handing off to another agent, provide:

HANDOFF TO: [Agent Name/Role]
CONTEXT: [What has been done so far]
CURRENT STATE: [Where things stand now]
NEXT STEPS: [What the receiving agent should do]
RESOURCES: [Relevant information, data, or tools]
DEADLINE: [Time constraints if any]

Example:
HANDOFF TO: Data Analyst
CONTEXT: I've gathered customer feedback from 3 sources (surveys, reviews, support tickets)
CURRENT STATE: Raw data collected and cleaned, 1,247 feedback items total
NEXT STEPS: Perform sentiment analysis and identify top 5 pain points
RESOURCES: feedback_data.csv, sentiment_analysis_tool, priority_ranking_criteria.md
DEADLINE: Analysis needed by EOD for tomorrow's product meeting
```

### 2. Collaborative Decision Making
```
When multiple agents need to make a decision:

PROPOSAL: [State the decision to be made]
MY PERSPECTIVE: [Your analysis and recommendation]
REASONING: [Why you recommend this approach]
RISKS/CONCERNS: [Potential downsides or issues]
SEEKING INPUT ON: [Specific aspects where you want other opinions]

Please provide your perspective using the same format.
```

### 3. Conflict Resolution Template
```
When agents disagree:

DISAGREEMENT: [Clearly state what the disagreement is about]
POSITION A: [First agent's position and reasoning]
POSITION B: [Second agent's position and reasoning]
COMMON GROUND: [What both agents agree on]
EVALUATION CRITERIA: [How to determine the best approach]
PROPOSED RESOLUTION: [Suggest a path forward]

Let's work together to find the best solution based on [objective criteria].
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Prompts

### 1. Tool Selection Framework
```
When you need to accomplish a task, follow this tool selection process:

1. TASK ANALYSIS: What exactly needs to be done?
2. AVAILABLE TOOLS: List all relevant tools you have access to
3. TOOL COMPARISON: 
   - Tool A: [Capabilities, pros, cons, best for]
   - Tool B: [Capabilities, pros, cons, best for]
4. SELECTION: Choose the best tool based on task requirements
5. EXECUTION: Use the tool with appropriate parameters
6. VALIDATION: Verify the results meet your needs

If the first tool doesn't work well, try alternatives systematically.
```

### 2. Error Handling in Tool Usage
```
When a tool fails or produces unexpected results:

1. ACKNOWLEDGE: "The [tool] didn't work as expected"
2. ANALYZE: "The error/issue appears to be [specific problem]"
3. ALTERNATIVES: "I can try [alternative approach/tool] instead"
4. FALLBACK: "If that doesn't work, I'll [backup plan]"
5. ESCALATE: "If all tools fail, I'll [inform user/ask for help]"

Always try at least 2 different approaches before concluding a task is impossible.
```

### 3. Tool Chaining Template
```
For complex tasks requiring multiple tools:

WORKFLOW: [Tool 1] ‚Üí [Tool 2] ‚Üí [Tool 3] ‚Üí [Final Output]

1. Use [Tool 1] to [specific purpose]
   - Input: [what you'll provide]
   - Expected output: [what you expect to get]
   
2. Take output from Tool 1 and use [Tool 2] to [next purpose]
   - Processing: [how you'll transform the data]
   - Expected output: [next expected result]
   
3. Continue chain until final goal is achieved

Validate each step before proceeding to the next.
```

- KEY INFORMATION: [Important details to remember]

This summary will help maintain continuity while reducing token usage.
```

### 2. Information Prioritization
```
When managing large amounts of information, prioritize by:

CRITICAL (Must Remember):
- [Information essential to the current task]

IMPORTANT (Should Remember):
- [Information useful for context or future tasks]

BACKGROUND (Can Forget):
- [Information that was relevant earlier but not now]

Focus your memory on Critical and Important information.
